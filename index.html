        <h1> FREEDOM FIGHTERS</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="main"> <p>Freedom fighters were people who sacrificed their 
        lives selflessly for the freedom of their country. Every country has
         its fair share of freedom fighters. People look up to them in terms
          of patriotism and love for oneâ€™s country. 
        They are considered the epitome of patriotic people.<br>
        Freedom fighters made sacrifices which one cannot even imagine 
        of doing for their loved ones, leave alone the country. The amount 
        of pain, hardships, and opposite they have endured cannot be put 
        into words. The generations after them will always be indebted to 
        them for their selfless sacrifices and hard work.<br>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(80, 28, 28); font-family: cursive;" ><u><b>Importance of Freedom Fighters</b></u></h3>
        One cannot emphasize enough on the importance of freedom fighters. 
        After all, they are the ones because of whom we celebrate Independence
         Day. No matter how small a role they played, they are very much significant
          today as they were in those times. Moreover, they revolted against the colonizers
           so as to stand up for the country and its people.Furthermore, most of the freedom 
           fighters even went to war to safeguard the freedom of 
        their people. It did not matter that they had no training; they did it for the pure intention
         of making their country free. Most of the freedom fighters sacrificed their lives in the war for independence.
         Most importantly, freedom fighters inspired and motivated others to fight injustice. They are the pillars
          behind the freedom movement. They made people aware of their rights and their power. It is all because of 
          the freedom fighters that we prospered into a free country free from any kind of colonizers or injustice.

          Bhagat Singh was born on September 27, 1907, in the village of Banga near Lyallpur district in Punjab, 
          British India. He was an Indian freedom fighter who is considered to be one of the most influential 
          revolutionaries of the Indian independence movement. Bhagat Singh joined the Hindustan Republican Association 
          (HRA) at a young age and became involved in revolutionary activities. He participated in several acts of sabotage 
          against British institutions, including an attempt to bomb the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. In 1929, he 
          and two other activists were convicted of assassinating John Saunders, a British police officer. Singh was executed by
           hanging on March 23, 1931, at Lahore jail at the age of 23. Despite his short life, Bhagat Singh left a lasting legacy
            in the struggle for Indian independence. He is revered by many as a martyr and symbol of resistance to British colonialism
             in India. His example continues to inspire new generations of activists worldwide.
