            Subhash Chandra Bose was born on 23rd of January 1897 in Cuttack. His father was
             Janakinath Bose and mother was Prabhavati Dutt. He was an Indian revolutionary during 
             British Era in India. His indomitable courage and defiant patriotism made him a national 
             hero due to which he is still remembered by Indians with glory and prid...
             His attempts to get rid of the British with the help of the Nazi party and Imperial Japan during the time of the second world war left him a troubled legacy.

Although he is now a well-known name to Indians, but at the time of revolution he was criticized a lot in Indian National Congress as his ideology did not match with the ideology of Gandhi, but sooner or later his sacrifices were recognised and that is the reason, in order to give more value to his contribution in the Indian Independence struggle, His birthday is now celebrated as “PARAKRAM DIWAS” in the whole nation. The day is now celebrated each year in memory of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, the unsung hero of the Indian independence struggle!  ...
