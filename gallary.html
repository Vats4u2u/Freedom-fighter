        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Bhagat Singh was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who
             participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police 
             officer in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.
             Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[a] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian 
             revolutionary[6] who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police
              officer[7] in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.
              He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly
               in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in 
               Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and 
               after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.
                Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism, he electrified a growing militancy in India 
                in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.
